The “Burst” language is a general-purpose interpreted programming language,
designed with C programmers in mind, meaning its syntax and functionality
shouldn’t differ too much from that of the C language.

**Disclaimer**: This specification is still in its very early stages, therefore
nothing contained within this document is final, unless otherwise noted.
